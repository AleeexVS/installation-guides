# Install SWIG

We use SWIG to generate language bindings for Python/Java/etc. from C/C++ code. Official website: [link](http://www.swig.org/).

## Install SWIG (Ubuntu 14.10)

We usually want to generate YARP language bindings, which now requires SWIG 3.

```bash
sudo apt install swig3.0
```

## Install SWIG (Ubuntu 16.04 and later)

```bash
sudo apt install swig
```
