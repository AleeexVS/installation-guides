# Install OpenCV

We use OpenCV for real-time computer vision. Official download page: [link](http://opencv.org/)

## Install OpenCV (Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
```

## Install OpenCV 3 (With contrib and Python 3 support)
Adapted from [this post](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/07/20/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-3-4-on-ubuntu/).

1. Upgrade any pre-installed packages:
