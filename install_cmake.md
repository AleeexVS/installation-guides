# Install CMake

We use CMake for project generating.

## Ubuntu (working on all tested versions)

Installing CMake on Ubuntu is quite straightforward. Note that you will be prompted for your password upon using `sudo`. Type:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui  # Recommended, as it contains ccmake.
```
