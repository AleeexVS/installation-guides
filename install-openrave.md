# Install OpenRAVE

We use the OpenRAVE core library for simulations. Official links: [[OpenRAVE](http://openrave.org/)]. [[OpenRAVE: Building and Installing page](http://openrave.org/docs/latest_stable/coreapihtml/installation.html)].

## Install OpenRAVE (Most modern Ubuntu, such as 14.04 or 16.04)

No official PPA, install from source. Note that you will be prompted for your password upon using `sudo`.

```bash
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
sudo apt install libqt4-dev qt4-dev-tools libxml2-dev libode-dev
sudo apt install libsoqt4-dev libcoin80-dev
sudo apt install python-scipy  # For openravepy. Note that Xenial sympy is 0.7.6, see next line
pip install --upgrade --user sympy==0.7.1 # OpenRAVE ikfast needs sympy 0.7.1, https://github.com/rdiankov/openrave/pull/407
sudo apt install libcollada-dom2.4-dp-dev  # Open .zae files, only Ubuntu 16.04
cd  # go home
mkdir -p repos; cd repos  # create $HOME/repos if it doesn't exist; then, enter it
git clone --branch master https://github.com/rdiankov/openrave.git
cd openrave; mkdir build; cd build
cmake .. -DOPT_VIDEORECORDING=OFF  # Avoids AV errors
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install; cd  # install and go home
```

Note that you may end up requiring over 2 GB of free space during the installation of `apt` dependencies. To avoid that, use the `--no-install-recommends` option as in:

`sudo apt install --no-install-recommends package`

Thus, `apt` would not try to install non-critical packages marked as *recommended* by the dependencies of OpenRAVE.

In case you run into `non-constant-expression cannot be narrowed from type 'double' to 'float' in initializer list [-Wc++11-narrowing]` errors (happened on OpenRAVE 0.15 and a Clang 6.0.0/7.0.0 compiler), reconfigure CMake with the following option:

`cmake .. -DOPT_IKFAST_FLOAT32=OFF`

## Install OpenRAVE (Ubuntu 12.04)

To install a precompiled version of OpenRAVE, type:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openrave/release
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openrave
```

## Install OpenRAVE (Windows)

Installers such as openrave-0.9.0-5cfc74-win32-vc100-setup are broken (break do to broken Boost 1.44 and Qt links, not to mention old VS version), so we go old-school.

## Install Additional Plugins: Flexible Collision Library (FCL)

The following is the Cannonical PPA way, which may not work for you. For more references regarding FCL from source on other/older versions, refer to these issues: [#3](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/installation-guides/issues/3), [#45](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/installation-guides/issues/45).

```bash
sudo apt install libfcl-dev
cd $HOME/repos/openrave; mkdir build; cd build; cmake .. -DOPENRAVE_PLUGIN_FCLRAVE=ON
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install; cd  # install and go home
```

The CMakes options when recompiling OpenRAVE are `OPT_FCL_COLLISION` / `OPENRAVE_PLUGIN_FCLRAVE`.

## Install Additional Plugins: OpenSceneGraph (OSG)

To get OSG to compile against OpenRAVE, first, you must download a specific version (all near 3.4.x should work) and set a CMake flag to use a specific Qt version:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libjasper-dev libpoppler-glib-dev libsdl2-dev libtiff5-dev libxrandr-dev
git clone --branch OpenSceneGraph-3.4.1 https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph
cd OpenSceneGraph && mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DDESIRED_QT_VERSION=4
make -j4
sudo make install
```

Then you must fix a set of environmental variables for OpenRAVE to actually detect OSG (else, error such as `Required > 3.4, failed because detected 3.4.2`):
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib64:/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
export OPENTHREADS_INC_DIR="/usr/local/include"
export OPENTHREADS_LIB_DIR="/usr/local/lib64:/usr/local/lib"
export PATH="$OPENTHREADS_LIB_DIR:$PATH"
```

The CMakes options when recompiling OpenRAVE are `OPT_QTOSG_VIEWER` / `OPENRAVE_PLUGIN_QTOSGRAVE` (and the viewer is called "qtosg" in contrast to "qtcoin").

## Additional Information

### Source Code Hacks

Here's a small patch tested on OpenRAVE 0.9 to enhance console output on joint limits (provides joint name, and angles in degrees):
```bash
cd $HOME/repos/openrave
wget https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/openrave-yarp-plugins/files/3896779/98-limit-output.patch.log
git apply 98-limit-output.patch.log # modifies `plugins/basecontrollers/idealcontroller.cpp`
wget https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/openrave-yarp-plugins/files/3898656/98-limit-output-2.patch.log
git apply 98-limit-output-2.patch.log # modifies `src/libopenrave/kinbody.cpp`
cd build; cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install; cd  # install and go home
```
